A 2D RPG Battle game framework. The characters are based on my real life friends, and all the moves are inside jokes within the group. I eventually plan on turning this framework into a fully fledged game,
and an AI is currently in the works. Graphics are also on the list of future plans.

Gameplay is explained in instructions.txt, and all card stats are available in cardinfo.txt.
